## semver-trust doctor

Diagnose this environment before verification (read-only)

### Synopsis

doctor runs read-only checks that surface, at authoring time, the mistakes
verification would later abort or mis-price — an unenrolled signing key, a
malformed registry, a missing trailer, a policy that will not parse — each with
the exact fix. It writes nothing and ends by printing the verify invocation it
preempts.

Persona (maintainer/contributor/agent) selects the check-set and is auto-detected
for humans (a principal enrolled in attestation_signers is a maintainer); pass
--persona to override. --persona agent is the one mode an agent is sanctioned to
run and restricts the run to a side-effect-free subset.
