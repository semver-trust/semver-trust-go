# Reading verify output

`semver-trust verify` walks a release range through the spec §10 pipeline and
prints one section per step. This page reads a real report — every excerpt
below was produced by this repository's own verification — and covers the one
distinction people misread most: an *abort* is not a *low trust level*.

## The shape of a passing report

Header, then steps. From this repository's `v0.1.0..v0.2.0` pre-flight:

```text
verify .  (v0.1.0..d00920566c75440f652f94f20ea7850d77d71b9f)
TO commit: d00920566c75440f652f94f20ea7850d77d71b9f
verify-time: 2026-07-12T04:15:00Z

[§10 step 1] policy
  path:      .semver-trust/policy.toml
  digest:    sha256:e085c25cb495b9cc7c20d569e62a4540ef09b545439ed7ab074ee56f5547ed25
  threshold: T2   strategy: demote   graph: none
  meta-paths (T2 required): .semver-trust/**, ... — check PASSED
```

Step 1 pins *which rules produced this decision*: the policy digest freezes
the exact policy text, and the meta-path check confirms every commit touching
guarded files individually met the required level.

```text
[§10 steps 2–3] commits
  SHA      LEVEL  AUTHORSHIP  REVIEW          SIGNER
  d009205  T2     ambiguous   human_distinct  noreply@github.com (merge)
  5348847  T2     agent       human_distinct  brad.pinter@gmail.com
  ...
```

One row per commit: its verified signer, its authorship class (from signature
identity + [Provenance trailer](trailers.md)), its review class (from stored
[attestations](attestation-refs.md)), and the per-commit level the spec §3.2
matrix assigns. This table is where you find *your* commit and see exactly how
it was classified — and where a forgotten trailer or an unenrolled reviewer
becomes visible.

```text
[§10 step 5] own trust (per scope)
  default: T2  (commits: 91e591d, 5348847, ...)

[§10 step 6] effective trust (adapter: none)
  default: own T2 -> effective T2 (floor source: default) <- target
```

**Own** trust is the weakest link among a scope's commits — one T0 commit
floors its whole scope. **Effective** trust additionally floors each scope by
everything it depends on (with a workspace graph; with `adapter: none` there
is one scope and the two are equal). The `floor source` names which scope is
responsible for the floor — when your level is lower than you expected, this
is the field that says *why*, and the commit list in step 5 says *which
commits*.

```text
[§10 step 7] evidence
  changed files: 53   changed LOC: unavailable
  semantic floor: minor (from declared_intent)
  blast score: unavailable
```

Evidence the decision consumes. `unavailable` is deliberate: anything the
configured providers cannot compute is reported as missing, never fabricated
(spec §1.1).

When run through `release`, two more steps follow: the §6.4 decision (channel
and version) and the emitted tag + attestation.

## Abort vs T0 — the distinction that matters

**T0 is a verified statement**: every signature checked out, and the evidence
shows no accountable human. It is a level, it is honest, and a T0 release can
ship (on the pre-release channel) and later be
[promoted](attestation-refs.md#supersession-not-mutation).

**An abort is the refusal to make any statement.** Something in the range
could not be verified — so the pipeline stops with a one-line reason naming
the failing step, and no level exists at all. Unverifiable is never T0
(spec §5.2); rendering a broken signature as "zero trust" would let attackers
*choose* T0 by breaking things.

Real aborts, and what to do about them:

```text
Error: §10 step 3 (verify signature): verify 5348847...: OpenPGP: signing key is not an allowed signer
```

A commit is signed by a key that is in no registry at the range tip. Enroll
the key ([trust material](trust-material.md)) — or, in legacy adoption, this
is the [key-archaeology loop](../guides/adopt-legacy-github.md#2-key-archaeology) telling you
which key to hunt next.

```text
Error: §10 step 1 (load policy): gpg-keyring: pgp: keyring contains no keys
```

Trust-shaped-but-malformed input fails closed at load: an empty or corrupt
registry aborts before any commit is examined. Fix the file, don't work
around it.

```text
Error: §10 step 1 (load policy): policy file ".semver-trust/policy.toml" not found in main's tree
```

The target commit's tree has no policy — remember that material is read from
the *tree being verified*, not from your working directory.

## The boundary disclosure

When a policy declares an [adoption boundary](policy.md) and a first release
verifies from it, the report says so — the reader must never mistake
"verified since the boundary" for "verified since inception":

```text
range: v0-import..main (FROM is the adoption boundary declared in policy — history before it is exempt and makes no claim; ADR-026)
```

## `--json`

Everything above, machine-readable: `verify --json` emits the full report —
policy digest, per-commit provenance vector, per-scope floors with sources,
evidence, and (via `release`) the decision block. CI integrations read
`.propagation.components[].effective` for badge and gate logic; the committed
report shape is versioned with the tool.
